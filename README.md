## Enviroments
### Python
I use uv for my main python stuff, and the virtual enviroment is using Python 3.11, which has support for most packages.

Use: `uv venv --python 3.11`

### Node.js
I use Bun.js for testing, which is just in my stack.

### API
I use Yaak & Insomnia for api trying & fetching.
